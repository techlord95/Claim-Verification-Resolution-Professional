( a ) 'workmen'', in relation to a company, means the employees of the company, being workmen within the meaning of clause ( s ) of section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947);

( b ) 'workmen's dues'', in relation to a company, means the aggregate of the following sums due from the company to its workmen, namely: -

( i ) all wages or salary including wages payable for time or piece work and salary  earned  wholly  or  in  part  by  way  of  commission  of  any  workman  in respect of services rendered to the company and any compensation payable to any workman under any of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947);

( ii ) all accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable to any workman or, in the case of his death, to any other person in his right on the termination of his

employment before or by the effect of the winding up order or resolution;

( iii )  unless  the  company  is  being  wound  up  voluntarily  merely  for  the purposes of reconstruction or amalgamation with another company or unless the company has, at the commencement of the winding up, under such a contract with insurers as is mentioned in section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 (19 of 1923), rights capable of being transferred to and vested in the workmen,  all  amount  due  in  respect  of  any  compensation  or  liability  for compensation under the said Act in respect of the death or disablement of any workman of the company;

( iv ) all sums due to any workman from the provident fund, the pension fund, the gratuity fund or any other fund for the welfare of the workmen, maintained by the company.

(c) 'workmen's portion'', in relation to the security of any secured creditor of a company,  means  the  amount  which  bears  to  the  value  of  the  security  the  same proportion as the amount of the workmen's dues bears to the aggregate of the amount of workmen's dues and the amount of the debts due to the secured creditors.

## Illustration

The value of the security of a secured creditor of a company is Rs. 1,00,000. The total amount of the workmen's dues is Rs. 1,00,000. The amount of the debts due from the company to its secured creditors is Rs. 3,00,000. The aggregate of the amount of workmen's dues and the amount of debts due to secured creditors is Rs. 4,00,000. The  workmen's  portion  of the  security  is, therefore,  one-fourth  of  the  value  of  the security, that is Rs. 25,000.'
